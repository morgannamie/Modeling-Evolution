# Modeling-Evolution

The notebook provided in this repo replicates the results found in the published work, "Evolution of Stochastic Switching Rates in Asymmetric Fitness Landscapes" by Marcel Salathe, Jeremy Van Cleve and Marcus W. Feldman.

The simulation in the notebook is for s = 0.05 (fitness cost of being maladapted in both environments).
